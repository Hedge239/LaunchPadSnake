# Launchpad Snake
Ever felt like you wanted to play snake on a tool for makeing music, well now you can!

    Note this only works natively on windows

### How to use
Just build and run the executable! Make sure you launchpad it plugged in first.

    Note if the lights or input are not working you may need to edit [DEVICEOUTPUT_ID] and [DEVICEINPUT_ID]

Input options can be changed by setting the respected [INPUT_KEY] to the ID of the buttons, the default is:

##### !!! Assumeing the Launchpad Mini mk1 is in use !!!

- 1 is UP
- 2 is DOWN
- 7 is LEFT
- 8 is RIGHT

#### Tested on
- Launchpad Mini mk1

### Too quiet?
Well I have you covered! You can play any [.wav] files for both background music and death sounds (more may come in the future)

Just have the following files, with the exact names, in the same directory as the executable

- music.wav
- death.wav
